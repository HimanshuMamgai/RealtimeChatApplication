# RealtimeChatApplication
I created a reatime chat application with the help of socket.io and node.js

Using my application you can chat with your friends and family in realtime.

I have also added functionaly like
  - Broadcast message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.

  - Added support for nicknames.
  
  - Shown how many users are online.

I will modify it more and more in coming time.
